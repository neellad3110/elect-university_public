      "Intro : University College Cork\n",
      "A tradition of independent thinking\n",
      "University College Cork is one of Ireland’s most prestigious universities. It boasts a vibrant, modern campus with an unsurpassed student experience in Ireland. A learning community where the student is at the heart of everything and the special relationship between student and lecturer is primary to our unique ethos.\n",
      "The campus is located a mere ten minutes’ walk from the heart of Cork city, a former European Capital of Culture. Cork is listed as a top ten location in the Lonely Planet guide which states it “has always had an unshakeable self-confidence and innate sense of pride”, a description which is equally applicable to the University itself.\n",
      "UCC’s uniqueness is comprised of several threads, which when woven together create the fabric of an exceptional university experience. Those elements include its cosmopolitan character; diversity of student backgrounds; successful access programs; excellence in teaching; high academic standards; flexibility in the delivery of programs; high completion rates and levels of graduate employment; excellent sporting facilities and a broad diversity of societies and social activities resulting in over two thousand student led events per term.\n",
      "The campus possesses a range of unique cultural and historical attractions, where preservation and progress coexist; the University’s original 1845 buildings designed by Sir Thomas Deane and Benjamin Woodworth are considered to be of international architectural significance. The Hibero-Romanesque glory of the Honan Chapel (1916), and the Glucksman Gallery (2004,) a visionary purpose built modern art exhibition centre, are located within a two minute stroll. Our setting in beautiful grounds which include the historic Main Quadrangle, impressive gardens and riverside walks all provide a rich, varied, and inspiring experience to student and visitor alike.\n",
      "UCC takes pride in the fact that its research income is consistently one of the highest in Ireland, as is industry collaboration income, and its research findings have had significiant impact in the global media. Imaginative teaching approaches and learning styles are fostered and supported while teaching and learning enjoy parity of esteem with research. A student-centred approach to education is embedded into the curriculum. Accordingly UCC attracts the highest calibre of students to over 120 degree and professional programmes throughout its four colleges.\n",
      "There are c.20,700 full-time students: c.14,000 of these follow undergraduate programmes, while c.4,300 are engaged in postgraduate study and research. UCC’s diverse student-body includes c.3,300 international students representing over 100 countries worldwide. The university’s Centre for Adult Continuing Education serves over 2,700 part-time students. The university is one of the Region’s largest employers, employing c. 3,000 people.\n",
      "UCC is the first University in the world to be awarded the esteemed ‘Green Flag’ award and remains the only Irish institution to be honoured in this way. UCC is ranked 9th in the world on the Global Green University Rankings and hosted the 5th annual conference earlier this year. We are co-founders of the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster (IMERC) one of the world’s largest research projects in sustainable energy and the marine. Similarly, UCC is an inaugural partner in a novel research collaboration between enterprise, Higher Education and the Irish Naval Service.\n",
      "UCC is host to a number of Ireland’s elite research centres including the Tyndall National Research Institute and the Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre (APC Microbiome Ireland)  both recognised global leaders. UCC leads out on 4 of Ireland's national strategic research centres and has co-leadership in a further two centres covering research in the areas of Energy, Food, Health, Nanotechnology and Data Analytics. UCC is at the leading edge of commercialisation and technology transfer.\n",
      "The university is acutely aware of its global commitments and hosts the Centre for Global Development recognising global challenges can only be addressed in collaboration between the developed and developing worlds. Joint degrees are awarded in partnership with University of Mekelle in Ethiopia. Campus societies enthusiastically support staff and student engagement with development issues. UCC is ranked 32 in the world Times Higher Impact Ranking which is primarily based on UN Sustainability Goals.\n",
      "UCC is actively engaged within its local community including partnership and volunteering by staff and students with a range of social and civic society organisations. A summertime open air concert, in conjunction with the local police and community services, is held annually on the main campus and the proceeds donated to local charities. A recent innovation sees students receive course credit for community based research activities.\n",
      "University College Cork’s inspiring 175 year history is hallmarked by excellence. We aim to build character, fulfil potential and move the human race forward. An ethos that is proudly continued today. Our unique university community is empowered by its focussed ambition to persistently deliver, by remaining on the cutting edge and shaping the world we live in.\n",
